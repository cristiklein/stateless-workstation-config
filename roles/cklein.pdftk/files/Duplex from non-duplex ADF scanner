# Duplex two ADF-scanned input PDFs into a single output PDF.
#
# The input PDFs are expected to be the result of passing the same paper twice
# through a scanner with Auto Document Feeder (ADF). The script assumes that
# the user did not physicall rotate the sheets for the second pass.
# Hence, the first PDF will contain the "up" side of all sheets. The second PDF
# will contain the "down" size of all sheets, rotated 180Â° in reverse order.
#
# Tested with Canon i-SENSYS MF742Cdw
